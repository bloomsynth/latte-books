# Deviations from Frappe Books

Latte Books follows Frappe Books **v0.36.0** as closely as possible (see
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md#porting-principle-stay-as-close-to-the-original-as-possible)).
Every place where it behaves differently is listed here, with the reason.

| Area | Frappe Books v0.36.0 | Latte Books | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Print templates | HTML/Vue templates rendered by Electron | Typst templates rendered to PDF | No browser engine in a native app |
| ERPNext sync | `ERPNextSyncSettings`, `ERPNextSyncQueue`, `FetchFromERPNextQueue` | Not ported; the tables are kept untouched | Out of scope (PLAN.md §1) |
| Right-to-left layout | Arabic and Persian use RTL | Left-to-right only for now | GPUI has no RTL support yet ([zed#31102](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/31102)) |
